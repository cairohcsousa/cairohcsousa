# üëã Hello and welcome...  
...to my Github profile!

Here is the place that I drop my code. That's it. Really.

But I might add that most of my projects are related to Python and Data Analysis.

## üßë About me
Well, I can say a lot about me. I was born in 1997. I am Brazilian üáßüá∑. I am a big Vasco da Gama fan üí¢. I'm never satisfied with myself, to a level that can even be interpreted as unhealthy.

But I also do can tell you about who I am, in an academic and professional sense.

### üéì Academic and professional info
In 2023 I got a MSc degree by Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia (UFU) in Economics. There I delved deep into Statistics, but didn't use Python. Academia is heavily focused on R and softwares like Stata and Eviews.

My liking for Python came somewhat naturally. I searched the web "how to become a data scientist" and voil√†: instantly into Python.

I'm currently trying to get better at Analytics, Data Visualization and Database Management.

I think I'm only at the beginning of the Analytics journey, and I would really make use of an opportunity (work, open source projects and so on) to improve my skills.

Thank you so much for reading through all of this.
Here, this is for you: üéÅ
